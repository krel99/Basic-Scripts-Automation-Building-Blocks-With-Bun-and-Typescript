## Inspiration & Credits

Project was inspired by a book titled "Automating with Node.js" by Shaun M. Stone. In its initial phase, this repository will trail the chapters inside a book, but some of the scripts may be missing and new ones may be created. Deprecated syntax and packages were updated and Node got replaced with Bun.
